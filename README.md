## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS ans Sass (scss)
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript


### Continued development

This was my first Javascript challenge in Frontend Mentor. I tried to finish it back in march, when I didn't have any tools in javascript. Nowaways i've learned a lot more, and I'll keep tackling FM's Javascript projects with both vanilla JS and React.
